This is a Minecraft mod.

It depends on [IC2][ic2] and [Buildcraft][bc].

It makes [UU-Matter][uum] from IC2 into a Buildcraft liquid, for use with various tanks. It also makes the Buildcraft refinery able to use liquid UUM and other liquids to duplicate those liquids (so far, just water, lava, and fuel).

It has [a thread on the IC2 forum](http://forum.industrial-craft.net/index.php?page=Thread&threadID=8269).

And [it looks kind of pretty](http://img.narc.ro/minecraft/mods/uum-in-tank.png).
